IRC chatbots using the ChatGPT API

## The bots, in brief

* bot.rb - A basic IRC chatbot with a system prompt to help with programming questions
* council.rb - A manager for a fleet of IRC chatbots (prompts in `council.yml`) that join a single room and answer questions in turn
* game.rb - A basic text-based social engineering game played over IRC; the goal is to convince the AI that you aren't a threat
